# Data Science for Public Policy: From Econometrics to AI
Repository for [Data Science for Public Policy: From Econometrics to AI @ ETH Zurich, Spring 2024](https://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?semkez=2024S&ansicht=ALLE&lerneinheitId=176702&lang=en) **([Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1snsoJVXi03qjOcP7LJSbw0h_LZRGLXO01ju0slzbnaY/edit?usp=sharing))**

**Lecturers:** [Sergio Galletta](https://sergio-galletta.com), [Elliott Ash](https://elliottash.com), [Christoph Goessmann](https://goessmann.io)

This course provides an introduction to data science, AI, and applied economics methods for policy applications. Students will put these techniques to work on a course project using real-world data, to be designed and implemented in consultation with the instructors.

## Deliverables

### Paper Presentations

Please choose a paper and **sign up** for a presentation slot in the [presentation schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BE7AYdNygbMA1QcU8weLlh-wg-jnq0QJ04GFo6yW8xw/edit?usp=sharing) with your group **by 11 March** (see the corresponding section of the [syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1snsoJVXi03qjOcP7LJSbw0h_LZRGLXO01ju0slzbnaY/edit?usp=sharing)). If you would like us to match you into a group with somebody else, please also let us know by the same date.

Upload your paper presentation [here](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/D98ToGWyWD7wxFL) by **6 June** using the naming scheme `paper_group_[##]_presentation.[pdf/pptx/key/txt]
`.

### Course Projects

Please choose a project and register it with us **by 16 April** [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BE7AYdNygbMA1QcU8weLlh-wg-jnq0QJ04GFo6yW8xw/edit#gid=1101149893) (be sure to go to the course project sheet, feel free to open an new [discussion](https://github.com/gochristoph/data-science-for-public-policy-2024/discussions) here to pitch your course project idea to others). 
* Projects presentations – 4 minutes per group – are on **30 May**.
  * Upload [here](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/D98ToGWyWD7wxFL) by **10 am** the same day using the naming scheme `project_group_[##]_presentation.[pdf/pptx/key/txt]`. We will prepare a laptop with all the presentations so that we waste little time between groups.
  * Potential structure:
    * What are you trying to do and why is it relevant?
    * How are you doing it (methods)?
    * What are your preliminary results?
    * What are your pain points?
* By **21 July** you will have to hand in your paper/web app including the replication package. Please use [this link](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/D98ToGWyWD7wxFL) to submit your project using the naming scheme `project_group_[#]_[app/paper].zip`.
